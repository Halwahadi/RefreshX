Project Idea: Random Drink Selector

Persona: Bob is a person who is bored with what he drinks. He chooses the same drink every time he goes to the store. He wants to try something different but is afraid and indecisive about what he wants to get. So he keeps getting the same thing. He wishes there was an app that can make the decision for him and tell him what to get today. When he opens the app, he can spin for a new drink. If its something he might want, he can get it. After he got the drink and he disliked it, he can swipe left and not see it again or swipe right to like it and save it for later. If you want to have something good today, he can view the list of his "favorites" or liked drinks. Either he could choose one or have it randomly selected.
